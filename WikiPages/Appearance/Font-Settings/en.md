# Font Settings
**Fluxbox doesn't control the font of external apps such as firefox or k3b.** Those fonts are controlled by their related toolkits (gtk, qt,...).
Changing fonts in Fluxbox applies only to its toolbar, menus (rootmenu, windowmenu, toolbarmenu, ...) and windowtitles.

## Fontnames
Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-9:bold:italic
