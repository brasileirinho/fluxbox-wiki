How do I add fluxbox to my GDM sessions menu.

Create the file: /etc/gdm/Sessions/fluxbox with contents:
```
#!/bin/sh
#
# /etc/gdm/Sessions/fluxbox
#
# global fluxbox session file -- used by gdm

exec /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/startfluxbox
```
Of course, change /usr/bin/startfluxbox to wherever your startfluxbox startup script is.

If the /etc/gdm directory doesn't exist, it may be /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/fluxbox on your computer.

The first section doesnt work for me, what can I do?

If your on debian distro you need to touch ~/.Xsession use your favorite editor edit ~/.Xsession and put exec /usr/bin/startfluxbox then save the file and restart your GDM session.

There is another way

On some distros you need to do something a bit different. For Debian, Ubuntu and a few other distros you need to follow this little guide instead.

If you decide you need to compile Fluxbox from git on your Ubuntu system you might have noticed, after it installed, that there was no way to start using Fluxbox, even if you tried to do

 $ startx `which fluxbox` -- :1

you get premission denied and are unable to connect to the X server (I only tried this on Hoary). So on to the fix....

 $ sudo gedit /usr/share/xsessions/fluxbox.desktop

Add to that file the following information:

 [Desktop Entry]
 Encoding=UTF-8
 Name=Fluxbox
 Comment=Highly configureable low resource X11 Window Manager
 Exec=/usr/local/bin/startfluxbox
 Terminal=False
 TryExec=/usr/local/bin/startfluxbox
 Type=Application

NOTE: The bold lines, /usr/local/bin/startfluxbox are for custom built fluxboxs. If you have installed with the package manager, use /usr/bin/startfluxbox.

NOTE: For FreeBSD 6.0 try to put fluxbox.desktop on /usr/X11R6/share/gdm/xsessions/fluxbox.desktop

Then save the file and restart your GDM session. This can be done by logging out of your current X session then pressing ctrl+alt+backspace note: NOT ctrl+alt+del (that would work but will also reboot your computer)

Customize the startup script

To customize the startup script see this page You will find information explaining how to start applications at startup, how to execute apps automatically after fluxbox has already started, and other topics.
