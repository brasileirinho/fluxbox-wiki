# the Toolbar

If you plan on using replacement toolbars, you should disable **systray** from the fluxbox toolbar, so it can be taken over. You do that by deleting it from

## Default Menus
There are 3 Menus in fluxbox by default.
- Main Application Menu, right click on the desktop
- Window Menu, right click on a windows titlebar
- Workspace Menu, middle click on the desktop
