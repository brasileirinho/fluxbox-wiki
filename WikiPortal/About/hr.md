# Fluxbox
## Å ta je Fluxbox
**Fluxbox is a lightweight Window Manager for the X Windowing System.**  
Fluxbox provides configurable [window decorations](), several predefined and unlimited custom [menus](), a [toolbar]() and [workspaces]().
The [slit](/en/wiki/Fluxbox-Internals/Slit/) can be used to dock small applications, e.g. [conky]().

Fluxbox supports the majority of the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specification, as well as numerous other Window Hinting standards. This allows all compliant window managers to provide a common interface to standard features used by applications and desktop utilities.

# Fluxbox-Wiki
This wiki was once a mediawiki, but it received lots of spam and a cumbersome registration process became neccessary. Then the wiki switched to github-pages and users needed a github account and had to edit raw html. This is the 2nd incarnation of the github-pages wiki, now it uses gatsby.js to automatically generate static websites from markdown files, so it got somewhat more intuitive again.

Every page has an edit-link in the bottom right corner that will take you to the source file on github, you can then edit the file online and create a PR, the rest has to be done by the maintainers.
